Unlike in the programming projects 1-5, where we gave you all the scaffolding and you just filled in the blanks, you now start from scratch. The programming project provide templates for how to do this, and the most recent video lectures summarize some of the tricks you will need (e.g. feature normalization, feature construction). So, this final project brings realism to how you will use machine learning in the real world.  </p>\n",

Economic and sociological factors vary a lot among counties in the United States. In addition, as you may observe from the election map of recent elections, neighbor counties show similar patterns in terms of the voting results. In this project you will bring the power of machine learning to make predictions for the county-level election results using Economic and sociological factors and the geographic structure of US counties. </p>\n",
